# NextEniac

NextEniac (http://www.nexteniac.com) is an app that provides the ability for students to connect with high school counselors and administrators at their educational institution to put them on a track for college readiness.  
  
Particularly, NextEniac contains optimization algorithms that reads a student's academic profile to determine the types of assignments and subjects that they need most help with (e.g. essays in English class). After this weakness is identified, the student's counselor is notified, and he/she can directly communicate with the student on how to improve.  
  
In order to increase student cognizance of their own progress, NextEniac is full of statistics, graphs, and trends that show a student's progress in a class average, GPA, or by assignment type. While current gradebooks only show a student's overall average, NextEniac allows a student to see their average for projects in English classes they have taken all 4 years in high school. Statistics include the five number summary, average progression, cumulative frequency, and more.

This app was released in November 2018, and it has continually been receiving updates, as per the students', counselors', and administrators' needs.
